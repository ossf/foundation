1. **Mission and Scope of the Open Source Security Foundation.** 
    - The purpose of the Open Source Security Foundation (the “OpenSSF”) is to inspire and enable the community to secure the open source software we all depend on, including development, testing, fundraising, infrastructure, and support initiatives driven by Working Groups (non-software focused) and Projects (software focused), each a “Technical Initiative”. The governance of each Technical Initiative will be as set forth in the applicable charter for each Technical Initiative. Participation in Technical Initiatives will be open to anyone, regardless of membership.
    
    - The OpenSSF raises funds to support the Technical Initiatives. The OpenSSF operates under the guidance of the Governing Board of the OpenSSF (the “Governing Board”) and The Linux Foundation (the “LF”) as may be consistent with The Linux Foundation’s tax-exempt status.
    
    - The Governing Board manages the OpenSSF. The OpenSSF will also have Committees that may be established by the Governing Board. Committees report to the Governing Board. Working Groups and Projects may be established under the Technical Advisory Council (the “TAC”).

2. **Membership**.

    - The OpenSSF will be composed of Premier, General and Associate Members (each, a “Member” and, collectively, the “Members”, or, alternatively, “OpenSSF Member” and “OpenSSF Members”, respectively) in Good Standing. All OpenSSF Members must be current corporate members of the LF (at any level) to participate in the OpenSSF as a OpenSSF Member. All participants in the OpenSSF enjoy the privileges and undertake the obligations described in this Charter, as from time to time amended by the Governing Board with the approval of the LF. During the term of their membership, all OpenSSF Members will comply with all such policies as the LF Board of Directors and/or the OpenSSF may adopt with notice to members.
    
    - Premier Members will be entitled to appoint a representative to the Governing Board and any Committee.
    - General Members, acting as a class, will be entitled to annually elect one representative to the Governing Board for every ten General Members, up to a maximum of three representatives, provided that there will always be at least one General Member representative, even if there are less than ten General Members. The Governing Board determines the election process.
    
    - The Associate Member category of OpenSSF Membership is limited to Associate Members of The Linux Foundation. The Governing Board may establish additional criteria for joining the OpenSSF as an Associate Member. If the Associate Member is a membership organization, Associate Membership in the OpenSSF does not confer any benefits or rights to the members of the Associate Member. 
    - OpenSSF Members will be entitled to:
        1. participate in OpenSSF general meetings, initiatives, events and any other activities; and
        
        2. identify themselves as members of the OpenSSF and have their logo or name displayed on materials denoting the OpenSSF Members.
3. **Governing Board**
    - The Governing Board voting membership will consist of: 
        1. one representative appointed by each Premier Member;

        6. one Associate Member Representative appointed by the OpenSSF Governing Board; and
        7. one Security Community Individual Representative elected by contributors to Technical Initiatives.
    - Each Premier Member shall have the right to designate a single observer to attend telephonic meetings of the Governing Board on a standing basis that shall not exceed designating more than two different individuals as an observer within a twelve-month period.

Observers may have the right to participate in any sessions, attend meetings in person, but shall not put forth or vote on any motion.
    
    - If the election of any of the TAC Representative, Associate Member Representative, or Security Community Individual Representative would result in a group of Related Companies having three votes, the respective role will be non-voting.
    
    - The Associate Member Representative will serve a renewable one-year term coinciding with the regular annual OpenSSF General Member elections.
    
    - The Security Community Individual Representative will be elected by the contributors to technical projects during the regular annual TAC election. The TAC Representative shall be the chairperson of the TAC, elected by the TAC shortly after the regular annual TAC election.
    
    - The representatives appointed by Premier Members, elected by General Members, and the Associate Member Representative each represent their respective Member organizations and may be replaced by their Member organization. 
    
    - If more than two representatives on the Governing Board are employed by the same Member or by a group of Related Companies (as defined in Section 8), those members will have their number of votes limited to two votes across all Related Companies.
