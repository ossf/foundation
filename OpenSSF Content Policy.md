# OpenSSF Content Policy

The OpenSSF Content Policy lays out the purpose, process, and guidelines for official OpenSSF content channels including the blog, news room, social media, website, mailing list, and project websites and social media channels.


# OpenSSF Blog


## Purpose

The purpose of the OpenSSF Blog is to provide informative and educational content about open source software security to the wider open source community, demonstrate thought leadership, share important milestones, and highlight the value of getting involved in the work of OpenSSF.



* Inform about the OpenSSF and its work
* Serve as central location for project news
* Highlight achievements and milestones
* Drive traffic to the site and ways to get involved
* Demonstrate thought leadership 
* Generate interest in improving open source software (OSS) security

**Content Calendar**



* [Content calendar](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O7K6XWWU7R1GUZ69XfTaFT8Xi0k_c2jJD5qsmbG9KVc/edit#gid=0)
* For OpenSSF staff, Marketing Committee (MC), Technical Advisory Council (TAC), Governing Board (GB) to collaborate and help get a sense for what is in the pipeline and to source new ideas

**Guidelines**

We aim to keep OpenSSF blog posts short and focused on what’s newsworthy, what’s cool, and what’s important to our community. We encourage links to source material for longer descriptions and deeper dives. Content should be presented in a conversational way that provides insight from the author’s expertise and perspective.



* **Topic Area**: Stick to topics directly relevant to open source software security
* **Tone**: Friendly, yet authoritative with a preference for first person voice
* **Word Count**: average of 300 – 900 words
* **Style**: Focus on readability. Write for the non-expert. Spell out acronyms upon first use. Break content into easily digestible parts with headings.
* **Attribution**: Identify author(s) and affiliations. When possible, try to have authors from multiple organizations to demonstrate breadth of support and collaboration
* **Intent**: No sales pitches please. While it is ok to highlight the work of an individual company, it should remain balanced and not be at the expense of others. Blogs exclusively about a for-profit-company’s products or services will not be accepted
* **Images**: Relevant graphics like charts, graphs, and photos are encouraged

**Submission Process**

If you’d like to suggest a topic area or volunteer to write a post, send an email to [marketing@linuxfoundation.org](mailto:marketing@linuxfoundation.org) with your name, topic, and few lines describing the post you’d like to write.
