The request is to include comments on many related topics beyond the written content. Submissions are expected by February 20, 2024 and the response from the OpenSSF requires approval from the Governing board.
* [WE HEREBY APPROVE/]: This Temporary CISA RFC Committee has delegated authority to send in the OpenSSF response, as being prepared in [Exhibit B](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FYY7DyLI7ReltlDN0ncdt1h6NwQK61MHlBKHpJ0l60A/edit#heading=h.m6m38593npz0), when they deem ready by their own consensus vote by the February 20th deadline. [/RESOLVED]
    * Jamie Thomas motioned to approve. 
    * CRob seconded the motion. 
    * All in favor; motion carried.

Technical Response Committee

* Brian Fox presented the links, which include the responses from OpenSSF that require approval of the Governing Board.

    Clarification - This is two separate votes, one being there is a new committee and the second being that we are re-scoping the PPC committee. We are combining these into one vote for simplicity with the AND representing her a clause of “IN ADDITION TO”

* [WE HEREBY APPROVE/]: That the Technical Response Committee (TRC) as defined in _[Exhibit C OpenSSF Committee Resolutions v2 - Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1I8RlqYUBHM_Wo70_b90sHwHyr9tIj5DQ_3daniCCK6Y/edit) should be considered by the OpenSSF Governing Board as a Committee of the Board AND the Public Policy Committee (PPC) Resolutions should be rescoped giving both delegated authority.  [/RESOLVED]
    * Brian Fox motioned to approve.
    * Stephen Walli seconded the motion. 
    * All in favor; motion carried.

Marketing Advisory Board



* Harry Toor discussed the proposal to establish Marketing Advisory Board 
* Premier Members exclusively serve on this committee or anyone employed from the member company.
* The Marketing Committee received only 2 out of 7 expected nominations and heavily relies on staff support. Its successful Editorial Panel operates independently, while the committee lacks delegated authority.
* Proposal: reimagine marketing committee as a task force to provide advice and take on focused initiatives
* Would like to see a scope - come back to the GC with this scope
* Would like to see regular reporting to the board - such as information
* [WE HEREBY APPROVE/]: The Governing Board establishes a Marketing Advisory Council that allows all OpenSSF members to participate as well as Linux Foundation Members. This Advisory Council reports to the staff. [/RESOLVED]

    * All in favor; motion carried.

SOSS Task Force



* UPDATE: Adrianne Marcum (AM) provided updates on the SOSS Task Force. They contacted and proposed roadmaps, shared them with other task forces and the TAC. The task forces are setting up work structures, including coordination with existing Working Groups. There's ongoing activity within the OSIS and EDU task forces. AM also highlighted the accomplishments of the Task Force.
* CTA: 
    * Original DC SOSS Summit participants for OSSIE and TRSI TFs join the discussion 
    * Folks with experience hiring secure software engineers reach out to EDU-TF to help with Focus Area #2 and #3
* AM also introduced the proposed roadmap and quarterly focus efforts for the following Task Forces for the remainder of 2024:
    * (OSSIE-TF) Open Source Security Integration and Enhancement Task Force 
    * (TRSI-TF) Trusted Repository Security Initiative 
    * (OSIS-TF) Open Source Integrity and Standardization Task Force 
    * (EDU-TF) Open Source Education Task Force
* Eric Brewer suggested that OPENSSF could potentially establish a core class model. This would involve centralized lectures, with individual colleges managing their own TA grading and sessions. He pointed out that similar practices are already in place for large classes at Berkeley, demonstrating effective scalability.
* SOSS EU Task Force 
    * Harry Toor introduced the launch of the EU Task Force for public policy advocacy, under the leadership of Georg from Ericsson. OpenSSF invites members to join this initiative. For involvement, reach out to [operations@openssf.org](mailto:operations@openssf.org).


### Training and Certification Plans



* David Wheeler discussed plans for training and certification.
* Feedback on the Secure Software Development Fundamentals Course was analyzed, suggesting the addition of multimedia (videos), labs, and refined questions. Related courses were analyzed, leading to the development of a proposed plan. A cybersecurity education survey will be conducted with LF Research to identify the top advanced areas.
* Main Thrusts:
    * Enhance fundamentals course with videos, optional labs, and refinements, remaining free.
    * Draft a course for managers overseeing software developers by June 30, 2023, focusing on expectations for secure software development.
    * Develop a relatively short advanced software development course ("201") based on identified areas, potentially funded by OpenSSF with fees.

* New TAC with expanded diversity and staggered seat terms.
* "Identifying Security Threats WG" renamed to "Metrics & Metadata WG."
* Adoption of DEI WG and protobom by Tooling WG.
* Ongoing efforts include conducting a TI documentation audit, clarifying TAC election processes, and enhancing the "Maintainer Experience" within the OpenSSF.


### Upcoming Events
