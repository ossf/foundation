# OpenSSF Committee Membership
Full committee membership policies are outlined in the [OpenSSF Policies and Procedures](https://github.com/ossf/foundation/blob/main/OpenSSF%20Policies%20and%20Procedures.md), but below is a brief overview:
- Every Premier Member can appoint one representative as a voting committee member. Only premier members can be voting members.
  - Premier Members may have multiple representatives from their organization attend meetings; however, only one will serve as the designated voting member.
- General Members may send a representative to observe committee meetings but do not have voting rights.

Please refer to the full policy document for additional details. 

If you are a premier member and want to participate in any committee, please email operations@openssf.org.
