### Scope:
The Committee shall support the Governing Board by providing financial and

Governing Board approval, monitor expenses against the budget and authorize
expenditures approved in the budget.

### Initial Membership:
The Governing Board Policies & Procedures defines Committee membership and the GB
encourages members to name their finance, budgeting and oversight experts to participate
in the committee.

### Delegated Authority:
The B&F has the following delegated authority: Follow the “Funding Release” Method.
Review requests from the GM for funding requests greater than $100,000 but less than
$250,000. Review underspend for more than $100,000, and move to different budget
categories as needed to meet OpenSSF strategic priorities. Distribution of funds should
follow the “funding release” method in the GB Policies and Procedures document. For
delegated authority to apply, there must be a line item for the budget item, and that budget
item must have the available funds.

The Committee will follow the “lazy consensus” method: For funding requests within the GM
remit amount, the GM will ensure a communication (e.g. email) is sent to report the intent to
approve a funding request to the B&F committee members. If no B&F committee input is
received in the 5 day window, the funding request will be considered approved by the B&F
committee.

For funding requests within the remit of the B&F Committee amount, the B&F chair will
ensure a communication (e.g. email) is sent to report the intent to approve a funding request
to the GB members. If no B&F committee input is received in the 5 day window, the funding
request will be considered approved by the GB.

## DevRel Committee Resolution

Whereas, the DevRel Committee has been running for some period of time, the OpenSSF
Governing Board resolves to recreate the DevRel Committee, with the following Scope,
Initial Membership, and Delegated Authority, and the understanding that the DevRel
Committee is subject to the GB P&P.

### Scope: 
The DevRel Community is affiliated with and managed by the Marketing Committee
for the purpose of evangelizing the mission and work of the OpenSSF and building strong
community outreach around end-users and open-source maintainers and contributors.
The DevRel Community Initiative is responsible for designing, developing, and executing
developer relations and outreach efforts on behalf of the Marketing Committee. A TAC Representative will be appointed by the DevRel Community to keep the OpenSSF TAC
apprised of DevRel activities.

### The activities of the committee include:
- Increase tooling adoption in critical OSS projects
  - Build easy adoption on-ramps for existing Projects. For the following projects,
a DevRel Representative will work with the project leads to leverage the

Cross-pollinate DevRel activities are focusing on existing programs that are
producing results.

    - Sigstore
    - SLSA
    - Scorecard
  - Coordinate prioritized, individualized outreach to critical OSS projects.
    - Define approximate Personas for critical OSS projects to develop an
outreach program for OpenSSF solutions. It will be important to
understand who the target audience is, their characteristics,
motivations, and their pain points in order to develop a unique
message for each Persona type. Some work may have already been
done in this area and could be leveraged. If there is no clear Persona
roadmap, it is recommended this committee work with the GB
Marketing Committee and TAC to develop.
    - The DevRel Committee will create a plan for reaching out to critical
OSS projects and offering OpenSSF’s expertise and solutions. They’ll
do this in collaboration with the TAC, knowing the TAC has existing
relationships and insights into these critical projects. The goal is to
minimize noise sent to OSS projects and establish the OSS
maintainer-buy in it will take to adopt OpenSSF projects.
- Build and maintain relationships with the greater end-user and open-source
communities.
  - Develop and communicate various channels for end-user and OSS
contributor participation to raise awareness of OpenSSF. This will include the
development of new channels which will allow participants to gain recognition
for their efforts including: competitions, hack-a-thons, blog-a-thons, and a
recognition program.
- Create an “OpenSSF Contributor Community” through easy contributor on-ramps
and contributor-led project events.
  - Ensure there is clear, welcoming documentation and pathways for individuals
wanting to contribute to OpenSSF projects (SLSA, OpenVex, sigstore).
Coordinate with OpenSSF staff to create OpenSSF contributor-driven
programming and space at events (such as OpenSSF Day).

## Public Policy Committee Resolution
Whereas the need for a Public Policy Committee is clearly outlined in the document,
“OpenSSF Public Policy Committee Rationale”, the OpenSSF Governing Board resolves to
create the Public Policy Committee (PPC), with the following Scope, Initial Membership, and
Delegated Authority.

### Scope:
The Committee shall provide the avenue for OpenSSF collaboration on public policy matters
related to software supply chain, security, and assurance as it impacts the development,
deployment, and use of open source software. The Committee is encouraged to solicit input
from OpenSSF members and other organizations or members of the OSS ecosystem as
appropriate.

### The activities of this Committee include:
- Receiving and distributing information about pending legislation, regulation, or policy
issues.
- Evaluating and proposing priority policy developments on which the community is
well-positioned to comment, exploring consensus, and establishing a committee
recommendation.
- Collaboratively developing and/or reviewing potential comments and responses (see
‘Purpose’ in the Rationale document) from the OpenSSF.
- A vote by the Public Policy Committee is required to officially start new work or to
send formal completed work from OpenSSF to another organization (e.g., a
government).

While the Committee may provide feedback as requested by governments and information
on public policy proposals, however, it cannot lobby as noted in [the Linux Foundation bylaws
section 8.8]([url](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/legal/bylaws)).

The PPC work in no way is intended to prevent member organizations and individuals from
responding to public organizations independently in their own capacity.

### Membership:
The Governing Board Policies & Procedures defines Committee membership and the GB
encourages members to name their public policy experts to participate in the committee.
The PPC may invite outside experts as non-voting participants as needed from time to time.
Reach out to Technical Initiatives through the TAC chair/TAC meetings for subject matter
experts.

### Delegated Authority:
The Public Policy Committee may propose recommendations (e.g., potential comments and
responses) to governments and other organizations if approved by Committee vote without
first requiring approval by the OpenSSF GB. The Committee will follow the “lazy consensus”
and report approved votes to the GB (e.g., via email) within 5 days, such as a vote to take on
new work or committee approval of completed work, to allow the GB time to review and
request input. If no GB input is received in the 5 day window, the Public Policy committee
recommendation will be considered approved by the GB.
